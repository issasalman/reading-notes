```
Block-level elements

<img> <b> <i>
```

* normal flow(position:static) the default
* relative positioning(Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.)
* absolute positioning(When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page)
* floats():
clear-right (e.g):The rightThe right-hand side of the 
box will not touch elements appearing in the same containing 
element
