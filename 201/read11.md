## Images

### Controlling sizes of images in CSS:
You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just 
like you can for any other box. 

The `<img>` elements 
appear in the HTML, rather 
than using width and height
attributes you can use these 
names as values for the class
attribute. 

### Alinging images Using  CSs
Rather than using the `<img>`
element's align attribute, web 
page authors are increasingly 
using the float property to align 
images.

### Centering images Using CSS
By default, images are inline 
elements. This means that they 
flow within the surrounding text. 
In order to center an image, it 
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.
Background Images
### Background Images
Background images are often 
the last thing on the page to 
load (which can make a website 
seem slow to load). As with any 
images you use online, if the 
size of the file is large it will take 
longer to download.
p { background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");}

### background-repeat background-attachment

background-attachment
