## JS Events:

### what is event in js
Events are the browser's way of indicating when 
something has happened (such as when a page has 
finished loading or a button has been clicked

### what is Binding
Binding is the process of stating which event you are 
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting 
for that event to happen upon.

There are three 
steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code. 
Together these steps are known as event handling. 
1. Select t he element 
node(s) you want the 
script to respond .(SELECT ELEMENT )
2. Indicate which event on 
the selected node(s) will 
trigger the response.(SPECiFY EVENT )
3. State the code you want 
to run when the event 
occurs. (CALL CODE )
