### How to create links 

Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything 
between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a> `tag. 

Linking to Other Sites known as an absolute URL.
for example   
 `<a href="http://www.empireonline.com">
 Empire</a>`

 Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site known as a 
relative URL.
for example  

`><a href="index.html">Home</a>`

Email Links used To create a link that starts up 
the user's email program and 
addresses an email to a specified 
email address

`<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>`

Opening Links in  a New Window used If you want a link to open in a new window

`<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">`

Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page
for exmaple  

`<a href="#arc_shot">Arc Shot</a>`

Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page
for exmaple 

`<a href="http:/www.
htmlandcssbookcom/
#bottom">`

we canposition elements using
* normal flow
* relative positioning
* absolute positioning 
* floats.

Positioning Elements can be by 
```
Block-level elements 
 Examples include:
<h1> <p> <ul> <li>
and Inline elements
 Examples include:
<img> <b> <i>
```

* normal flow(position:static) the default
* relative positioning(Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.)
* absolute positioning(When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page)
* floats():
clear-right (e.g):The rightThe right-hand side of the 
box will not touch elements appearing in the same containing 
element
* z-index : is sometimes referred to as the stacking context
* layout grids : you can use it to positioning items on a page

Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
You can include multiple CSS files in one page
Grids help create professional and flexible designs

## Functions
### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
![w](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/JavaScript-function-tutorial.jpg)
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

There is A BASIC FUNCTION or we can declare functions

VARIABLE SCOPE
can be local or global
