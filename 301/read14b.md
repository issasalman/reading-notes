## Project Ideas

Being a developer is great , you can build almost anything you want! Sometimes, however, it's difficult to decide what to build next as there are so many different project ideas out there

   The API service is for those of you interested in using our movie, TV show or actor images and/or data in your application. Our API is a system we provide for you and your team to programmatically fetch and use our data and/or images.


2. The Meal API

   The mean API gives you access to random meal data to use it in your application. This API contains all the meal categories with images, ingredients, videos, the country of each meal and many more features.
