#  Mongo and Mongoose



| SQL | NoSQL | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) |  called as non-relational or distributed database. | 
| table based databases  |  document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores| 
| SQL databases have predefined schema | dynamic schema for unstructured data.|
| SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL |  database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb| 
| SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment |databases are not good fit for complex queries.  | 
| SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage | NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage  |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?


If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined


## Give a real world example.
Netflix

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
High velocity read/write with no frequent updates. High performance and scalability. No complex queries involving multiple keys or joins.

## Give a real world example.
LinkedIn. .

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
NoSQL

## What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language

## What is a realational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another


## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
logical data structures


## What is a ‘schema’?
The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system


## What is a NoSQL database?
any non-relational database


## how does nosql work
an approach to databases that represents a shift away from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS)

## What is inside of a Mongo database?
MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.



## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID)
