## Who is Roy Fielding?
Some guy. He's smart. that  writes the first web servers,  sent documents across the internet… and a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.


## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

GET calls the information asked for.

## What does a POST do?

POST adds the information to another system.

PUT replace data in system
