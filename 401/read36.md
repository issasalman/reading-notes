## Tips 

### Communicate!
be sure that the communication between you and the interviewer keeps running 

### Restate the Question

 Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for perhaps the question is similar, but not the same 

### Ask About Edge Cases

It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up. That’s great it shows you’re analytical and will work hard to try to prevent bugs (which often crop up due to edge cases).

### Ask About Test Cases

This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate knows about testing!”

### Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
Think of the logic first, before actually trying to write code.
Ask if the Pseudo code makes sense… It’s possible they’ll be more interested in how you think and want to discuss your pseudocode with you.
If your pseduo code looks good and it logically makes sense, you may not even need to finish the functional code. Being able to reason through the pseudo code is sufficient for many great companies.


### Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in. If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief. If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.

### Stuck? Ask for Help!
If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally.
