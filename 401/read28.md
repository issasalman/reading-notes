# Django CRUD and Forms

An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.


Django Forms take a lot of the work out of all these steps, by providing a framework that lets you define forms and their fields programmatically, and then use these objects to both generate the form HTML code and handle much of the validation and user interaction.

## Django form handling process

Django's form handling uses all of the same techniques that we learned about in previous tutorials (for displaying information about our models): the view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns an HTML page . What makes things more complicated is that the server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and redisplay the page if there are any errors.

## the main things that Django's form handling does are:

1. Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user
2. Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form
3. Clean and validate the data
4. If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.
5. If all data is valid, perform required actions (e.g. save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, etc.)
6. Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.

### Declaring a Form
Form data is stored in an application's forms.py file, inside the application directory. Create and open the file locallibrary/catalog/forms.py. To create a Form, we import the forms library, derive from the Form class, and declare the form's fields. A very basic form class for our library book renewal form is shown below â€” add this to your new file:
```
from django import forms

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")
```

### The template
```



  <h1>Renew: {{ book_instance.book.title }}</h1>
  <p>Borrower: {{ book_instance.borrower }}</p>
  <p{% if book_instance.is_overdue %} class="text-danger"{% endif %}>Due date: {{ book_instance.due_back }}</p>

  <form action="" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <table>
    {{ form.as_table }}
    </table>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>

```
