# Wireframe
## **What Is a Wireframe?**
### A wireframe is a basic, two-dimensional visual representation of a web page, app interface, or product layout. You can think of it as a low-fidelity, functional sketch. Product designers and UX (user experience) professionals draw up wireframes to communicate how they plan to arrange and prioritize features, and how they intend for users to interact with its product or website.

### Wireframes typically depict only functionality, not the true style and visual elements of the final product. It’s why most wireframes look simple: grayscale instead of colors, placeholders for images, and Lorem Ipsum for text.

## **Benefits of Wireframes**
1. Communicate the team’s decisions about which functionality and content to prioritize in the product or site.
2. Depict how the team envisions users to interact with the product or site.
3. Document and communicate how various aspects of the app or website will connect.
4. Establish consistent ways of displaying particular content across the site.

## **What is HTML?**
### HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

## **Why we use HTML?**
### We use HTML to add content to webpages and to make a structure for it.

## **How we use it?**
### Simply by wrapping it by tags Just like <p></p> <img> <br> and so on.

## **Semantics**
### In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

## **Some Semantic elements**
### These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:

* <article>
* <aside>
* <details>
* <figcaption>
* <figure>
* <footer>
* <header>
* <main>
